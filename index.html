        <h2>Pathways for Undergraduate and Masters Students</h2>
        <p>Our current requirements are built on a collection of pathways, each representing a well
           defined area within computer science. Concentrators interested in particular areas might 
           choose the courses included in particular pathways. Conversely, concentrators who are 
           unsure of their areas of interest but who have particularly enjoyed certain courses 
           might choose pathways that include these courses.
          <br><br>
          Pathways are a means for organizing our courses into areas. Undergraduates doing an AB 
          must complete one pathway; those doing an ScB, two. Master’s students must complete one 
          pathway. The courses allowed for undergraduate pathways are somewhat different from those 
          allowed for master’s pathways, as explained below.
